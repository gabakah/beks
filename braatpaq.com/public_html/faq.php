		<br><li>Why should I get a Braatpaq?</li></br>
		<br><br>Everybody is getting a laptop these days for use everywhere. 
			With the BRAATPAQ, users get the added benefit of watching videos
			in their cars (it's easier than holding the laptop).</br>

			It's an affordable accessory for mobile video entertainment. No need to 
			put off the purchase of your mobile video entertainment unit.</br>

		<br><br><li>Do you recommend any specific laptop brands for use with 
			the BRAATPAQ?</li></br>

		    <br>We do recommend that you use a laptop with an 
			active matrix (TFT) screen that is equipped with a DVD drive or a
			USB port if you want to use it for watching video.  The TFT screen
 			allows a wider viewing angle, thus making it easier for both second
 			and third row seat passengers to view the screen.</br>
		    <br>We also recommend that you have a laptop with a screen no larger
			than 15 inches and weigh no more than 10 pounds. A laptop with very 
			large screen may not fit in the bag and could reduce the life of the
			bag if it is too heavy.</br>
			
		<br><br><li>Will my laptop overheat in the bag?</li></br>
		    <br>No. When properly installed with the additional accessory, the heat
			from the laptop is easily dissipated. Feedback from our customers
			indicate that there have not been any problems.</br>
			
		<br><br><li>We have a nice laptop but all our movies are on VHS 
			tape!</li></br>
		    <br>With a few inexpensive accessories and some creativity, you can 
			still use your laptop as your video screen. You will need a power
			inverter, your VCR and another device such as WinTV with a
			USB connection. The WinTV will act as a passthru for the laptop
			to receive VCR signals. Contact us at service@braatpaq.com for more
 			information</br>
			
		<br><br><li>Can I use my game accessories?</li></br>
		    <br>Yes, you can attach your video games and accessories as you would 
			when you are home.</br>

		<br><br><li>Can I use my portable DVD player?</li></br>
		    <br>The BRAATPAQ was designed primarily for use with laptop 
			computers but will also work with portable DVD players if 
			installed properly with some extra padding.  Portable DVD players 
			are generally smaller and lighter than laptop computers so 
			they may not be well suited for the Braatpaq.</br>

		<br><br><li>My car does not have standard head rests in front</li></br>
		    <br>Without a headrest, the BRAATPAQ cannot be attached 
			in the vehicle. For those vehicle models such as Ford Explorer, 
			Windstar, and Dodge Caravan with the built-in head rest, 
			you will have to extend the the adjustable straps to get the ideal 
			viewing setup.</br>

		<br><br><li>My car is a subcompact</li>
			<br>The Braatpaq works in most vehicles including subcompacts. We 
			have happy customers who use the Braatpaq in Nissan Sentras and Ford
 			Escorts.</br>
		
		<br><li>I'm not sure if I want my children to play with my laptop</li></br>
			<br>When using the Braatpaq, the screen is the only exposed part of 
			the laptop, thus reducing tampering to a minimum.  Besides, your 	
			children will not want to jeopardize their entertainment.</br>

		<br><li>But the Braatpaq is just another laptop computer carrying 			case</li></br>
			<br>The Braatpaq is more than just another computer carrying case.
			The primary function of the Braatpaq is to allow use of the video
			in the car. You can watch movies or play video games while on the
			road. We would like to think of the Braatpaq as a Mobile Video 
			Entertainment System that also works as a laptop carrying case.
			There is no other case like it.</br>
