	        <br>The BRAATPAQ (patent pending) works by attaching the 
		included straps to the bag and hanging them over the front
		seat head rests.</br>
	<ul>
	    <br>Installation instructions:</br>

	    <br><li>Attach the included straps as shown in the picture</li>
	    <br><li>Mount in the vehicle with each strap over each of the front head rests. It is easier to mount the Braatpaq
		in the vehicle first without the laptop inside</li>
	    <br><li>Adjust the straps if necessary to the desired height in the vehicle and open the bag</li>
	    <br><li>Open the laptop and start the movie according to 
		your computer’s instructions</li>
	    <br><li>Adjust the window size if necessary and attach the 
		accessories, if any</li>
	    <br><li>Open the laptop computer as flat as it allows and place it inside the bag. The screen will be sticking out</li>
	    <br><li>Fasten the horizontal velcro straps to secure the 
		laptop and zip up the Braatpaq</li>
	    <br><li>Tilt the screen to the desired angle. Note that the laptop does not have to remain opened as flat as possible. That will depend on how it fits in your particular vehicle</li>
	    <br><li>You are now ready to watch your movie</li>
